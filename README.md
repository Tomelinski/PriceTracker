# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In each project directory, you can run:

### `docker compose up -d`

This will build and start each project in a docker container, you can also enter the specific project and run the same command.

### `docker compose watch`

In the Parent folder of all of the projects you can run `docker compose watch`. That will run a watcher for any changes made in the `/client/src` and `/server/` directories.
